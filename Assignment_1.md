I found the learning process very interesting but I had problems trying to implement flexbox. Moreover, I was struggling to embed the videos as 
they do not show on the website, despite being in the same folder. Modifying the videos sizes and padding was a bit confusing to me as I was not sure how
to sepecify the diffrence between them. The process of positioning the videos and aligning them using flexbox was very confusing and did not make sense to 
me. I learnt more about css and html through mdn webdocs and W3 school which had a lot of recources and examples. I would like to master Flexbox in the 
future and easily layout the desired website so that it is more aesthetically pleasing and more professionly done.
