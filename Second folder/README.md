LTAE NIGHT DRIVE VIBES, is an interactive simulator that allows the user to listen to different songs while scrolling through the page. 
The website allows the user to change their vehicle and change the song as they scroll. I used popular songs that teenagers from my generation,
and entourage would listen to while driving late at night. The song choice for me is the most important facet of the project. Because eventhough
the concept of the website is very straightforward and simple, the music allows the user to have a meditative experience and remember past night drives
with friends and loved ones.
In this project I tried to put a little of my identity and my memories as theses songs remind me of happy summer memories, meditaive nights and endless
conversations in the streets of TUNIS.
I would have loved to make the Background change depending on the songs, but I had different problems trying to implement both features together.
