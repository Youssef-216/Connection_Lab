Obimy, "an app which gives a different way to pay attention and feel care of close ones without text messages/pictures/video". 
The app allows loved ones to connect on a deeper level than through texts and video. The app allows you to send virtual kisses, hugs 
and tickles to your friends on the app. The app represents the user as squares in the screen and when you send an interaction the phone vibrates 
and makes certain sounds e.i: sound of a hug, sound of kisses, sound of tickling...
I liked that the app offers a new and different way of interacting between people (especially long distance relationships) eventhough the vibrations and 
sound effects are minimalistic and do not contain a lot of data they offer a comforting message on a more basic human level. I found the app refreshing
and innovative as it abandones the previous communication tools and seeks to create diffrent types of links.
I believe that the app could be better if it incorporates chats and if the squares representing the users are switched to more realistic images such as 
bitmojis or other animated personas. Moreover, the app could include more personalised custom based interaction that are special to each user. 
The app could also include voice mail which would deepen the interaction level.
