Feeling Blue?
Concept:
This is a playful website simple and minimalist aimed mainly for teenagers. On scroll the website displayes random quotes from historical figure, 
random advice, Kanye quotes and random dad jokes that are all fetched from APIs. Moreover, the website allows the users to submit their name, country 
and advice into a dataset created through sheetsdb that would later on be displayed for another user of the website.
