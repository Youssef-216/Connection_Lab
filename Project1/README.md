# Feeling Blue?

## Concept:
This is a playful website simple and minimalist aimed mainly for teenagers. On scroll the website displays random quotes from historical figure, 
random advice, Kanye quotes and random dad jokes that are all fetched from APIs. Moreover, the website allows the users to submit their name, country 
and advice into a dataset created through ‘sheetsdb’ that would later on be displayed for another user of the website.
The Goal of this website is to uplift the mood of the user and entertain them, while keeping it an interactive experience through allowing users to 
contribute in creating the contact. This will allow the user to feel like a part of a life project in constant shift and evolution.

## Design:
The user experience has been specifically engineered to nudge the user to discover, try and experiment with the intercept. Since the website does not have any instructions, the user is encouraged to 'discover' the content of the website on their own. The buttons have been turned into 'self-explanatory' images to enhance the aesthetic of the website, but they also nudge the user into clicking them, thus making the user experience more fulfilling and playful.
The design of the website is purpucioussly clean cut and minimalistic, since items appear organically with big fonts on the screen as the user scrolls through the website. The gradient of the background colour slowlly veirs from dark blue to red as the user scrolls throughout the webpage, thus reflecting 
the mood of the user. 

## Technicalities:
### APIs:
The website fetches four random APIs from the web and implementing each of them had its own challenges, e.g: Accessing the necessary element from the 
fetched data, getting the propper keys, and fixing 'sheetsdb'.
