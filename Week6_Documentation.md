# Week6: Solar System Planets data project
## Vision
I want this website to provide the users with diffrent data related to the planets in our solar system, by implementing Node JS I want to create diffrent 
Get functions that would allow the user to get different information depending on different interactions.
## Node JS:
I have learnt a lot throughout this project, working on both the server and the client's side was one the most exciting parts of the project.
What I strugled a bit with was setting the diffrent GET functions, as I wanted to create diffrent short cuts that would allow the user access a random 
planet's data. That however, was challenging as the "/random"  and "/planet/:planet" would not work. Despite the attempts to debug the code the feature 
would not work.

## Website Style:
I wanted the add more design to my website and make it more user friendly. I was however, unable to link my HTML to my css file. Despite the multiple 
attempts to fix this problem it persisted and hindered the process of designing the website and making it more user friendly.

## Potential solutions:
I plan to learn more about node JS and the ways I can create short cuts that would allow the users to access precise data about the website.
I want to add design to the webpage by incorporating css and maybe P5.
